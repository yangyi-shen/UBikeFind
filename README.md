# UBikeFind ðŸš²

> ðŸ—’: Only works for the Kaohsiung municipality

**Problem:** I often go to my nearby UBike bike rental station and find that there are no available bikes. I then have to travel extra far to the next closest station, when I could've gone there directly from my house instead.

**Solution:** Determine bike availability with the official UBike API from the Kaohsiung government, and display it on a website I can check before I leave the house.
