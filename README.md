# UBikeFind ðŸš²

I regularly take UBikes, and have more than once ran into the issue of an empty station. I recently found out that Kaohsiung City provides a public API that lists every UBike station, and the number of bikes in them. Consequently, I decided that I'd make a website that allows me to check how many bikes the stations near me each have.

## TODO ðŸ“’: 

- [ ] Finish demo before dinnertime (30 minutes)
- - [x] Get data from KH gov using Fetch API
- - [x] Parse data for stations near me (è²¡æ”¿éƒ¨é«˜é›„åœ‹ç¨…å±€, é«˜é›„å¸«ç¯„å¤§å­¸(æ´»å‹•ä¸­å¿ƒ))
- - [x] Display data using HTML
